In this homework, we focused on reading in a csv data, and running some summary statistics, manipulating a dataset using pandas. 
Mean, median, and standard deviation were all used to understand the distribution of the Philadelphia parks dataset. 
We also gained experience in plotting histograms in python.
I worked on this notbook by myself but had quick discussions with classmate, Coryn.
