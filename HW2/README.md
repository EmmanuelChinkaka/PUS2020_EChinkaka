Assigned Reading 
The paper titled 'What is the Question' By Jeff Leek and Roger Peng was a nice read to understand the common mistakes in data science and data analysis in general.
From the flowchart, I learnt that the data analysis flow can be misunderstgood if the question being addressed is mistaken. Depending on how the question is been answered, the data analysis can be categorized into: Destriptive, Exploratory, etc.

Assignment
I
The Hypothesis were formulated and submitted through the google links for each situation

II
General idea:
Detecting changes of mining site areas over time (Multi-temporal analysis)
Alternative Hypothesis:
The extent of mining areas at the beginning of the mine life is significantly lower (smaller) than the mining extent area over time. 
Null Hypothesis:
The extent of mining areas at the beginning of the mine life is the same or larger than the mining extent area over time.
Comments on experimental design:
The experimental setup would involve measuring the size of the mining area over the years and make a comparative reference to size of the mining area as previously recorded at the beginning of the mine life
