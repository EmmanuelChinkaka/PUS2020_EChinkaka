# DeepDreaming with TensorFlow 
#We perform a DeepDreaming with TensorFlow using a random noise image and an Eagle's image.

#produces DeepDream images from user-supplied photos using Google's pretrained Inception neural network. 
It can be used as a starting point for further exploration in visualizing convolutional neural networks.
