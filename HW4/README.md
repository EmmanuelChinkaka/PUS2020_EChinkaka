### In this homework, we looked at Geospatial Analysis of CitiBike data for New Your City. 
There were three main components of the homework: 1. Working with a Shape File of Census Tracts, 2. Explore CitiBike data, and 3. Assigning points to polygons.
I discussed some of the homework components with Elizabeth and Coryn.
